TURING COMPLETE

6 X 8 DISPLAY

SERIAL CONTROL MODULE



Overview:

	The purpose of this module is to provide a serial interface for the 6x8 matrix display.
	This way, the processor can send all instruction data over a single line.
	The module assembles the serial data and feeds it to the display.



Directions:

	Contolling the display is split into two instruction types:
	The pixel data packet;
	And the display refresh command.

	Sending the pixel data packet will not immediately update the display.
	The display will only update once a seperate refresh command is sent.

	The pixel data packet has 12 bytes.
	The first byte is the packet identifier.
	The remaining 11 are the pixel data instructions.

	The packet identifier for pixel data is 0x10.
	This tells the module that the next 11 bytes will be the pixel data instructions.

	The 11 pixel data bytes are ordered as follows:
		1: Display column-select.
		2: Display row-select.
		3 - 5: RGB value.
		The module's serial interface is configured for most significant byte first.
		This means that the highest-value byte in the total assembled value is sent first.
		So, for an RGB value, first R is sent, then G, then B.
		6 - 11: Pixel value.
		Similar to RGB, the pixel data is sent most significant byte first.

	Numerous instruction packets can be sent prior to refreshing the display.

	To refresh the display, simply send 0x11.



Example:

	The following instructions set:
	The top left quarter red,
	The top right green,
	Refreshes,
	Then sets the bottom left blue,
	And bottom right black.
